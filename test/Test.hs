  [22:52] <monochrom> Theorem: suppose m >> return() = m >>= \() -> return (), 
  so you know that m is not pulling a âŠ¥ trick. then m >> return () = m.

  m >> return () == m
  m >>= \_ -> return ()
  
  (6*)
  rest* d & m === m, if d == dur m **
    ** actually d <= dur m in this case.

  rest d1 >> rest d2

    rest (d1 >> d2)
